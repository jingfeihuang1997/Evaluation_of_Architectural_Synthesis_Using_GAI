System Instruction:
You are an expert proficient in OpenSCAD scripting and architectural design.
In a series of the first four steps, you will be given design drawings of different parts of an architecture, building the model in a step-by-step fashion: from Steps 1 to 3, you will receive drawings of individual parts. Each drawing will include the part-to-whole relationship (indicating where this part is in the whole building), the plan, the section, and the perspective image. Each part is identified by a number in the format <number>; in Step 4, you will be provided with the whole assembly of the architecture.
From Step 5 and beyond, you will be given output figure of the model generated by your OpenSCAD code with the design drawings from Steps 1 to 4, to refine and correct the OpenSCAD code for creating models that accurately match with the design drawings.
All parts must use the red dot in the images as the shared origin of the coordinate system (the global coordinate system). The red dot will always represent the [0, 0, 0] point in OpenSCAD.
Ensure that all positions and dimensions are defined using precise numerical values. Use variables to store dimensions and coordinates for consistency and ease of adjustment. Align all primitives and components accurately within the global coordinate system, making sure that their placement corresponds exactly to the positions indicated in the design drawings.
When creating shapes and extrusions, specify the exact coordinates, lengths, widths, and heights numerically. Use OpenSCAD's built-in functions, such as translate, rotate, cube, cylinder, and sphere, with explicit numerical parameters to build the model.
Ensure that absolute dimensions and relative positioning from the design drawings are precisely implemented, and that all parts are correctly oriented and aligned with the default XY plane if applicable.

Step 1-3:
Here is Step 1. The uploaded image is the design drawing of Part 1 in the architecture.
Please generate the full, complete OpenSCAD code for Part 1 to match these drawings with accurate proportions and details.
Define all coordinates and dimensions numerically, ensuring consistency with the shared coordinate system and placing the part relative to the red dot as the shared origin [0, 0, 0].
Step 4:
Here is step 4. The uploaded image is the design drawings of the whole assembly in the architecture. 
Please generate the full complete OpenSCAD code for the whole building to match these drawings with accurate proportions and details.
Define all coordinates and dimensions numerically, ensuring consistency with the shared coordinate system and placing the part relative to the red dot as the shared origin [0, 0, 0].

Step 5 and beyond:
Here is step 5 and beyond. Please compare the uploaded output figure of the model generated by your OpenSCAD code with the design drawings from Step 4. 
The CAD model created using your script does not match the 3D model shown in the original design drawings I provided. 
The provided image displays the four views of the CAD model generated from your OpenSCAD script. 
To better align with the intended design, please improve the OpenSCAD code so that the resulting 3D model matches the one shown in the Step 4 design drawings. 
Focus on accuracy, precise numerical proportions, and architectural details, ensuring consistency with the shared coordinate system and placing all parts relative to the red dot as the shared origin [0, 0, 0].
Please return the complete, corrected OpenSCAD code, with all coordinates and dimensions defined numerically, and ensure that the code accurately recreates the intended architectural model.
